# straycats
Straycats is a silly demo application that I use to explore various technologies and architectures.

The idea is an application where anyone can report the sighting of a cat, and users can signup and search for reported cats, and choose to be notified when a critter matching their criteria is reported.

# Ideas to explored
* Deploy to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk
* AWS DynamoDB and SQS
* Frontend using bower, grunt/gulp and good test coverage
* Possible a mobile (android) application
* Using geolocation when reporting a sighting or searching

# Technologies
More to come...
